getCell(row, col) with invalid coordinates: Returns ' ' (space) to indicate invalid cell.
getWinner() when there's no winner yet: Returns ' ' (space).
Why getWinner() is const but makeMove() is not: getWinner() only checks game state (no changes). makeMove() modifies the board, current player, and move count.
Board full and nobody has won: isGameOver() should return true (tie condition).
getCurrentPlayer() at the start of a new game: 'X'.
